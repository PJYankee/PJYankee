I am a full time software engineer and enjoy designing and implementing backend solutions mostly in Java. I am also a part time professor of Computer Science at [SUNY Polytechnic Institute](https://sunypoly.edu/) where I teach Computing Fundamentals as well as Object Oriented Design in Java.


Most of my repositories are private, the ones that I shared are just personal projects that have been fun to tinker with over the years!

I love Baseball, punk music and all things Syracuse Orange 🍊🍊🍊 Go Cuse!!!
